I am just a cowboy, lonesome on the trail
A starry night, a campfire light
The coyote call and the howlin' winds wail
So I'll ride out to the old sundown

I am just a cowboy, lonesome on the trail
Lord, I'm just thinkin' 'bout a certain female
The nights we spent together ridin' on the range
Looking back, it seems so strange
